# proto 1

This version does not include internal timebase calibration.

Initial testing has shown that it functions as a sampling oscilloscope with a bandwidth of approximately 6.7 GHz.

There is an error in this design: I swapped op-amps at the last minute, and accidentally reversed the inputs in the scheamtic. The board needs rework to correct this.

This version is abandoned, as it was never entended as a final product, just as a testbed for an evolving design.
